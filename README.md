This is the second QAP for my databases course at Keyin College. Here is an excerpt from the instructions:

'''
Problem 1: University Course Enrollment System
Scenario
Youâ€™re tasked with developing a system to manage university students, professors, courses, and their enrollments.

A single student can register for multiple courses
A single professor can teach multiple courses
A course can only have one professor
A course can have multiple students

Problem 2: Online Store Inventory and Orders System
Scenario
You are developing a system to manage products, customers, and their orders in an online store.
'''

Most of the tables, data to be inserted, and tasks to perform were explicitly outlined. In Prolem 2 I decided to do the following for extra practice:

--Added a total_price column to the orders table to store the order total.
--Added a check constraint on products.stock_quantity to ensure it doesn't go below zero.
--Added a check to ensure the stock doesn't go negative.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
